The goal is to identify key variables that impact academic success and personal satisfaction, allowing the university to implement targeted interventions to improve student outcomes. One intervention they're considering is called \"Study Buddy\" to ensure all students have at least one peer they can turn to to study with! Using the data provided, they are hoping to begin understanding what variables are important for matching student pairs.\n",
