        "For this final project, we will take on the role of consultants for Aggie Investments, a Real Estate Investment Firm. In recent years, there has been a significant trend among investment firms to acquire properties for use as rental assets. While various geographies have been proposed, our focus is to assess the opportunities within a specific, rapidly growing market: Nashville, Tennessee.\n",

The objective is to explore the data comprehensively and provide informed recommendations to Aggie Investments regarding the potential of entering this market, the types of listings they should acquire, and how they should manage those listings. The project will involve data preparation, exploration, and the application of unsupervised machine learning models to uncover deeper insights and patterns within the data. These findings will guide our final recommendations to the firm.\n"
